# Github Organisation Badges

![image](Assets/octobadges-screenshot.png)

Adds Travis, Coveralls, PyPi (where Language == 'Python'), and License badges to GitHub Organisations items.
Through adding these badges automatically, we hope to promote better development practices by ensuring your code
has CI, testing, and clear licensing. If these aren't available, it's easy to see from an organisation repo
if best practices are being carried out, and if all the code is building correctly and well tested.

### Installation

Available for installation from the Chrome Extension Store.

### Caveats

OctoBadges is just looking to add badges wherever it can. For pypi we do have a test to check if the
defined programming language is Python, before adding the badge though. More of these rules can be easily added.
